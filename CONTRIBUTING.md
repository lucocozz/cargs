# Contributing to cargs

Thank you for your interest in contributing to cargs! We welcome contributions from everyone, whether it's in the form of bug reports, feature requests, documentation improvements, or code contributions.

## Contribution Workflow

We use the "Issue First" approach to manage contributions:

1. **Create an Issue First**: Before submitting a Pull Request, please create an issue to discuss the change you'd like to make:
   - For bugs, create a Bug Report
   - For new features, create a Feature Request
   - For questions or discussions, use GitHub Discussions

2. **Wait for Feedback**: Wait for project maintainers and community members to discuss the issue.

3. **Implement Changes**: Once there's agreement on how to proceed, implement your changes.

4. **Submit a Pull Request**: Reference the issue in your PR using the format "Fixes #ISSUE_NUMBER".

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. **One PR per issue**: Keep your changes focused and limited to addressing a single issue.

2. **Follow coding style**: Follow the coding style used throughout the project (use clang-format).

3. **Write tests**: Add tests to cover your changes where applicable.

4. **Update documentation**: Keep documentation up-to-date with your changes.

5. **Keep PRs small**: Smaller, focused PRs are easier to review and more likely to be accepted.
