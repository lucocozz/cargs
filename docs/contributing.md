### GitHub Workflow for Open-Source Contributions

!!! abstract "The Fork & Pull Request Model"
    This project follows the standard GitHub fork and pull request workflow. If you're new to this process, here's how it works:

=== "Step 1: Fork the Repository"
    Navigate to the [original repository](https://github.com/lucocozz/cargs) and click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner. This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.
    
    ![Fork Button](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-6294/mw-1440/images/help/repository/fork_button.webp)

=== "Step 2: Clone Your Fork"
    ```bash
    # Clone YOUR fork to your local machine (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cargs.git
    cd cargs
    
    # Add the original repository as a remote called "upstream"
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/lucocozz/cargs.git
    ```

=== "Step 3: Keep Your Fork Updated"
    ```bash
    # Fetch changes from the original repository
    git fetch upstream
    
    # Merge changes from upstream/develop into your local develop branch
    git checkout develop
    git merge upstream/develop
    
    # Push the updates to your fork
    git push origin develop
    ```

### Building the Project

After cloning your fork, you can build the project:

=== "Using Meson"
    ```bash
    # Build
    meson setup .build
    meson compile -C .build
    ```

=== "Using Just (recommended)"
    ```bash
    # Build static and shared libraries
    just build
    ```

### Running Tests

!!! warning "Important"
    Always run tests before submitting a pull request to ensure your changes don't break existing functionality.

```bash
# Run all tests
just test

# Run only unit tests
just test-unit

# Run only integration tests
just test-integration

# Run only functional tests
just test-functional

# Run a specific test
just test-one unit_strings
```

## Contribution Workflow

!!! abstract "Process Overview"
    We use the "Issue First" approach to manage contributions:
    
    1. **Create an Issue First**: Before submitting a Pull Request, create an issue to discuss the change you'd like to make
    2. **Wait for Feedback**: Allow the community and maintainers to provide input
    3. **Implement Changes**: Once there's agreement on how to proceed
    4. **Submit a Pull Request**: Reference the issue in your PR

### Creating Issues

Before writing any code, create an issue to discuss your proposed changes:

- For bugs, create a **Bug Report** using the template
- For new features, create a **Feature Request** using the template
- For questions, use the **Question** template or GitHub Discussions

Provide as much detail as possible to help maintainers understand your proposal or the bug you've encountered.

### Making Changes

After setting up your fork, follow these steps to make changes to the codebase:

1. **Ensure your fork is up to date** with the original repository:

    ```bash
    git fetch upstream
    git checkout develop
    git merge upstream/develop
    ```

2. **Create a branch** with a descriptive name:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature  # or bugfix/issue-description
    ```

    !!! tip "Branch Naming Conventions"
        - `feature/` - for new features
        - `bugfix/` - for bug fixes
        - `docs/` - for documentation changes
        - `refactor/` - for code refactoring
        - `test/` - for adding or updating tests

3. **Make focused changes** that address only the issue at hand

4. **Add tests** for your changes, especially for bug fixes and new features

5. **Ensure code quality** with formatting and linting:

    ```bash
    # Format your code
    just format
    
    # Run static analysis
    just lint
    ```

6. **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive commit messages:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: add support for xyz"  # or "fix: resolve issue with abc"
    ```

    Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format when possible:
    
    | Type | Description |
    |------|-------------|
    | `feat` | New feature |
    | `fix` | Bug fix |
    | `docs` | Documentation change |
    | `style` | Formatting, etc; no code change |
    | `refactor` | Refactoring code |
    | `test` | Adding or updating tests |
    | `chore` | Updating build tasks, etc; no code change |

### Submitting Pull Requests

=== "Step 1: Push Changes"
    ```bash
    # Push your branch to your fork
    git push origin feature/my-new-feature
    ```

=== "Step 2: Create PR"
    Go to the [original repository](https://github.com/lucocozz/cargs) on GitHub. You should see a "Compare & pull request" button for your recently pushed branch.
    
    ![Compare & Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-23923/mw-1440/images/help/pull_requests/pull-request-start-review-button.webp)
    
    Click this button and fill out the PR template completely.

=== "Step 3: Reference Issue"
    Make sure to reference the original issue in your PR description using "Fixes #123" or "Closes #123" syntax. This automatically links the PR to the issue and will close the issue when the PR is merged.
    
    Example: `This PR fixes #42 by implementing the new feature.`

!!! tip "PR Guidelines"
    1. **One PR per issue**: Keep your changes focused on addressing a single issue
    2. **Follow coding style**: Ensure your code is formatted according to the project standards
    3. **Write tests**: Add tests to cover your changes
    4. **Update documentation**: Keep documentation in sync with your changes
    5. **Keep PRs small**: Smaller, focused PRs are easier to review and more likely to be accepted

## Coding Guidelines

### Code Style

cargs follows a consistent coding style enforced by clang-format:

| Rule | Value |
|------|-------|
| Indentation | 4 spaces (no tabs) |
| Line length | 100 characters maximum |
| Function braces | On new line |
| Operators | Spaced (e.g., `a + b`) |
| Naming | Descriptive, lowercase with underscores |

!!! note "Automatic Formatting"
    The style is defined in the `.clang-format` file. Always run `just format` before committing changes to ensure your code follows the project style.

### Documentation

Good documentation is crucial for maintaining the codebase:

- Document all public functions, types, and macros
- Write clear comments for complex logic
- Update documentation when changing functionality
- Use markdown for documentation files

```c
/**
 * Parses command-line arguments according to the defined options.
 *
 * @param cargs Pointer to an initialized cargs context
 * @param argc  Argument count (from main)
 * @param argv  Argument values (from main)
 * @return CARGS_SUCCESS on success, error code otherwise
 */
int cargs_parse(cargs_t *cargs, int argc, char **argv);
```

### Testing

!!! warning "Tests are Required"
    All new features and bug fixes should include tests to verify their correctness.

- Write tests for all new features
- Update tests when modifying existing functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR
- Aim for high test coverage (especially for core functionality)
